# Worklog for Ricky Miranda 
### Math 353 w/ Professor Bryant
Note: This worklog will be organized in chronological order with most recent logs at the top (to avoid the nuisance of having to scroll all the way down). 
Total Hours: (4 hrs)
| Date & Time           |   Notes/Task completed |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 3/14/2022 17:50 to  | Organizing data on excel to make it easier to import and use on R. Used to have one sheet full of data but I am now separating them into different sheets based on the different categories. The categories are men and women and each one has squat, bench, deadlift, and total.|
| 3/10/2022 13:30 to 16:30 (3 hrs) | Looked at database and exported information manually to an excel sheet since there doesn't seem to be an excel sheet for these records. Names, weight class, and weight lifted were recorded. Additional datapoints that were included were bodyweight to weight lifted ratio as well as a scoring mechanism known as the wilks formula (uses the Wilks Coefficient). This excel sheet is included in this repository. Also updated the readMe file to give background information for the motivation for this project as well as the personal motivation for the project.
| 2/25/2022 19:30 to 20:30 (1 hr)| Surfed through various databases (such as openpowerlifting, uspa, usapl, etc. to look to see which data would be best to handle. Decided that a well known federation that includes random drug testing and has its competitors pledge to not using performance enhancing drugs would be best.|
