| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2/25/2022 19:30 to 20:30 (1 hr)| Surfed through various databases (such as openpowerlifting, uspa, usapl, etc. to look to see which data would be best to handle. Decided that a well known federation that includes random drug testing and has its competitors pledge to not using performance enhancing drugs would be best.|
| 3/10/2022 13:30 to | Looked at database and exported information manually to an excel sheet since there doesn't seem to be an excel sheet for these records. Names, weight class, and weight lifted were recorded. Additional datapoints that were included were bodyweight to weight lifted ratio as well as a scoring mechanism known as the wilks formula (uses the Wilks Coefficient). This excel sheet is included in this repository.
