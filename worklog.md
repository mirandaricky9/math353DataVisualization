Total Hours: (20.0 hrs)
| Date & Time             |   Notes/Task completed   |
| :---------------------: | :----------------------: |
|05/2/2022 14:30 to 17:30 (3 hr) | Made final edits regarding projects and took into consideration the suggestions. |
| 4/26/2022 14:30 to 16:00 (1.5 hr) | Made a few edits regarding the paper for the final project. The edits that were made were suggestions given by Professor Bryant. |
| 4/24/2022 14:00 to 17:30 (3.5 hr)| Making a final paper to showcase the results that were found with the datapoints that were used in one specific meet. |
| 4/17/2022 15:00 to 20:00 (5 hr) | Imported more formulas that are used as strength measurements and formatted so that the scores are calculated for the newly inputed lifters as well as the old ones. Imported the excel data into R and created a script that plots both mens' and womens' scores against their weight in different colors. Currently working on trying to get a bigger database to work with from openpowerlifting.org |
| 4/16/2022 16:00 to 17:00 (1 hr) | Worked on grading contract. Also used python to import a hundred more datapoints to look at. |
| 3/14/2022 17:50 to 19:50 (2 hr) | Organizing data on excel to make it easier to import and use on R. Used to have one sheet full of data but I am now separating them into different sheets based on the different categories. The categories are men and women and each one has squat, bench, deadlift, and total. Also imported new data regarding a specific meet to look at multiple different competitors at the same weight class. All data has been made import friendly into R and is ready to be looked at.|
| 3/10/2022 13:30 to 16:30 (3 hrs) | Looked at database and exported information manually to an excel sheet since there doesn't seem to be an excel sheet for these records. Names, weight class, and weight lifted were recorded. Additional datapoints that were included were bodyweight to weight lifted ratio as well as a scoring mechanism known as the wilks formula (uses the Wilks Coefficient). This excel sheet is included in this repository. Also updated the readMe file to give background information for the motivation for this project as well as the personal motivation for the project.
| 2/25/2022 19:30 to 20:30 (1 hr)| Surfed through various databases (such as openpowerlifting, uspa, usapl, etc. to look to see which data would be best to handle. Decided that a well known federation that includes random drug testing and has its competitors pledge to not using performance enhancing drugs would be best.|
